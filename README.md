# MultipleCropRecommendation
This repository contains files for the project on the "Multiple Crop Recommendation System"
**Overview**
This project contains code implementing three machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. The project includes a ready-to-use dataset that has been cleaned for analysis.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is provided in the 'edited_crop_data.csv' file. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned for use in the machine learning algorithms. It contains relevant features and the target variable for training and testing the models.

**Algorithms Implemented**
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
Algorithm that classifies data points based on the points that are nearest to it.
Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Algorithm that finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.
Random Forest:
An ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes as the prediction.
